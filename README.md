PublicCodeLibrary
=================

An Xcode 4 project to build a Real Static Universal Framework (armv6, armv7, simulator) of my iOS library. The library contains some useful methods simplifying daily programming.

Quick Facts
-----------

- this is a freely usable and distributable library for iOS development
- it targets to simplify daily development tasks by providing useful and well documented code (e.g. categories, wrapper classes, ...)

Next Steps
----------

- give Xcode project its new name (the repo name)
- select a license for this lib
- enhance documentation
- building a iOS framework instead of a library
