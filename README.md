PublicCodeLibrary
=================

Here are some quick facts about this repository:

  • this is a freely usable and distributable library for iOS development
  • it targets to simplify daily development tasks by providing useful and well documented code (e.g. categories, wrapper classes, ...)

Next Steps

  • give Xcode project its new name (the repo name)
  • select a license for this lib
  • enhance documentation
  • building a iOS framework instead of a library



Please use it freely and even more important send mee ANY feedback you have.

Cheers
